## 👋 Hi, I’m @Romain-Muller

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things about web programmation and the numeric in general.

I also really want to perfectly master JavaScript. 


- 🌱 I’m currently working on "Programme Rocket" of Belivemy.


- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every project which need front-end competences.

I enjoy team learning because of the adaptation of every contributors on the projects and their obstacles and difficulties.

With team working we are all learning new skills whatever they are.
